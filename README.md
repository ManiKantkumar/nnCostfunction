# nnCostfunction
## Basic Overview
Using large data set, train an algorithm such that the cost of computing should be minimised and then backtest it. 

## What this code does ?
#### This code computes the gradient and cost function of Neural Network Model and regularization.
Use forward propagation and return the cost in J variable.
Evaluate the partial derivatives of  the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2.
Now implement backpropagation algorithm to compute gradient of Theta1 and Theta2(Theta1_grad & Theta2_grad).
Implement regularization with the cost function and gradient by computing the gradients for the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad.
##### sigmoid function: f(z)=1/(1+e^-z)

## How to run this code ?
#### In ex4.m file this nnCostfunction.m is being called. 

## Some results.
#### Neural Networks have several uses: 
- In identifying patterns or trends in data,
- well suited for prediction or forecasting needs.
- applicability to real world business problems(e.g- Airline Marketing).
- In recognising diseases using scans.
