# nnCostfunction

## What this code does ?
#### This code computes the gradient and cost function of Neural Network Model and regularization.
#### I am using forward propagation and returning the cost in J variable.
#### Evaluating the partial derivatives of  the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2.
#### Now implementing backpropagation algorithm to compute gradient of Theta1 and Theta2(Theta1_grad & Theta2_grad) using partial derivatives evaluated.
#### Implement regularization with the cost function and gradient.To do so computing the gradients for the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad .
