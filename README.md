# nnCostfunction

## What this code does ?
### This code computes the gradient and cost function of Neural Network Model.
### I am using forward propagation and returning the cost in J variable.
### Evaluating the partial derivatives of  the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2.
### Now implementing backpropagation algorithm and to compute gradient of Theta1 and Theta2 using partial derivatives.

## How to run this code ?


## Some results.
