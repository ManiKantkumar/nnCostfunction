# nnCostfunction

## What this code does ?
#### This code computes the gradient and cost function of Neural Network Model and regularization.
#### I am using forward propagation and returning the cost in J variable.
#### Evaluating the partial derivatives of  the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2.
#### Now implementing backpropagation algorithm to compute gradient of Theta1 and Theta2(Theta1_grad & Theta2_grad) using partial derivatives evaluated.
#### Implementing regularization with the cost function and gradient by computing the gradients for the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad .
#### sigmoid function: f(z)=1/(1+e^-z)

## How to run this code ?
#### In ex4.m file this nnCostfunction is being called. 

## Some results.
#### Neural Networks have several uses: 
##### In identifying patterns or trends in data,
##### well suited for prediction or forecasting needs.
##### applicability to real world business problems(e.g- Airline Marketing).
##### In recognising diseases using scans.
